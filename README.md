# Revenue Forecast
Revenue forecast as the foundation for dynamic pricing

Business Problem:
Real-time automated price generation moves into focus for online retailers. Every day, category
management faces the challenge of adapting thousands of products to changing market factors.
We can easily predict the revenue when the prices are static but it is challenging to predict the
revenue when the prices are generated dynamically. This happens completely automatically
when using an intelligent pricing tool. Prices reflect customer appreciation and lead to increased
sales.
To help better understand the influence of Dynamic pricing on revenue and make more accurate
revenue predictions, we will develop a statistical model for predicting future revenue using
historical anonymised transaction data of a real mail-order pharmacy found online. The special
feature of this dataset is the product prices were dynamically generated automatically.
